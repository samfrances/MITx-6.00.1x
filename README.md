> This course is the first of a two-course sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, and Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems.
> 
> What you'll learm
> - A Notion of computation
> - The Python programming language
> - Some simple algorithms
> - Testing and debugging
> - An informal introduction to algorithmic complexity
> - Data structures

Unfortunately, the rules for this course prohibit me from sharing my problem solutions, so these will not be included.
